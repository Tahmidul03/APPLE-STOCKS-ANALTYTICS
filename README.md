Building on a statistical analysis of the study of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock forecasting by introducing deep learning models and a more comprehensive evaluation framework. While the previous section utilized classical time-series techniques such as ACF, PACF, and ARIMA to model linear dependencies and assess stationarity, this part explores the predictive capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks — architectures designed to capture nonlinear behaviors, long-term dependencies, and complex market patterns that traditional models may miss.

After preparing the dataset through normalization and sequence generation, both LSTM and GRU models are trained to forecast next-day adjusted closing prices. Their performance is then measured using a combination of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Directional Accuracy (DA). These metrics together provide a balanced view of each model’s strengths: RMSE evaluates overall prediction precision, MAPE assesses proportional error relative to price scale, and DA measures the model’s ability to correctly forecast upward or downward movements — a critical factor in real trading scenarios.

Finally, results from the deep learning models are compared directly with the ARIMA model developed in Part 1. This head-to-head comparison highlights how classical statistical methods and modern neural networks differ in accuracy, behavior, and sensitivity to market fluctuations.

By combining LSTM, GRU, ARIMA, and a diverse set of performance metrics, this continuation of the project delivers a richer and more practical understanding of AAPL’s forecastability — offering deeper insights into which modeling approach provides the most reliable predictive power.
